Here It Is in 1 Sentence</a>. This &ldquo;1 Sentence&rdquo; from <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/satya-nadella-3145136/>Satya Nadella</a> who got it by reading this book was:</p><blockquote><p><em>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a know-it-all; be a learn-it-all.&rdquo;</em></p></blockquote><p>This quotation rang my bell, and this sound told me that I will really love this book.</p><p>Satya is very inspiring to me, he has this mindset and this leadership that I admire. Recently, for the end of FY17 and the beginning of FY18 (i.e last day of June 2017), as Microsoft employees, we received an internal email from him and he had this really great statement:</p><blockquote><p><em>&ldquo;Every day I ask myself if I am approaching my work with a growth mindset and more importantly recognizing all the fixed mindset moments that I can learn from.&rdquo;</em></p></blockquote><p><img src=https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-GmDs_2iG7ao/WXyy7aVMRzI/AAAAAAAAOcU/K9-JBnweJEAh0dawwmTdQ-6i0Y603ycUgCLcBGAs/s320/51FexyX8WQL._SX322_BO1%252C204%252C203%252C200_.jpg alt="Book cover of &amp;ldquo;Mindset, the new psychology of success&amp;rdquo;"></p><p>On the front cover we could find what this book is going to deal with: &ldquo;How we can learn to fulfill our potential for: parenting, business, school, relationships&rdquo;. The author, based on personal and professional stories and illustrations by research studies, brings us throughout this book in a journey between two mindsets: fixed versus growth.</p><p>Here are some of the statements I have found really interesting to understand and illustrate how we could go from the first one to the second one.</p><h1 id=be-smartintelligent>Be smart/intelligent
