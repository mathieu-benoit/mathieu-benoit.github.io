<a href=#roles class=h-anchor aria-hidden=true>#</a></h2><p>2022 was my first year as <strong>DevRel Engineer</strong>. I really enjoyed this year.</p><p>I moved from Cloud Sales to Cloud DevRel. On purpose, I chose to earn less money to have more fun and making more impact.</p><p>My title was Senior Cloud Developer Platform Engineer (DPE).</p><blockquote><p>DPEs are at the intersection of Developer Advocacy, Technical Writing, Product Management, and Engineering. - <em><a href=https://medium.com/google-cloud/developer-programs-engineer-say-what-b12829729693>Source</a>.</em></p></blockquote><p>I was both an <strong>Individual Contributor</strong>, focused on GitOps and Security with GKE – and a <strong>Tech Lead</strong> in my team to connect the dots between the people, the products, the docs and the communities (internal and external) in order to enable them and improve the end users experience.</p><p>I brought my <strong>15 years of experience</strong> as Software Engineer and Solution Architect to broader communities. I really felt I was making impact.</p><p>I learned how to actually do <strong>evangelism and advocacy work</strong> as DevRel Engineer.</p><p>I directly worked with Product Managers, Software Engineers, Tech Writers, Developer Advocates, Customer Engineers, and many other stakeholders. The role I was given allowed me to be the bridge, the glue, between all of them.</p><p>I inspired and helped teammates and colleagues to accelerate their technical enableemnt and grow in their career.</p><p>I was focus on Kubernetes, more precisely on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) and Anthos.</p><p>More than ever, I continuously shared with others what I learned around <strong>Kubernetes</strong> and its ecosystem for the enterprise customers.</p><p>I nurtured my passion and appetite with <strong>Security best practices with containers and Kubernetes</strong>.</p><h2 id=activities-and-artifacts>Activities and artifacts
<a href=#activities-and-artifacts class=h-anchor aria-hidden=true>#</a></h2><p>I conducted and wrote 9 impactful <a href=https://developerrelations.com/developer-experience/an-introduction-to-friction-logging>friction logs</a>, generating 200+ issues and feature requests for both products and docs.</p><blockquote><p>Including usability testing in the product development process helps establish the documentation’s usefulness and effectiveness. Most importantly, it improves user experience and increases the product’s success. - <em><a href=https://medium.com/@dubemobinnaesiowu/how-to-test-technical-documentation-usability-74ad0c8d27c>Source</a>.</em></p></blockquote><p>I actively participated in 4 products/features launch. Activities I conducted were: design document reviews, UX mocks testing, internal and public preview features testing, demo samples building, docs creation or update, friction logging, blog for launch authoring, etc.</p><ul><li><a href=https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/new-pci-dss-policy-bundle/>Harden your Kubernetes clusters and monitor workload compliance at scale with new PCI DSS policy bundle</a></li><li><a href=https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/apply-policy-bundles-and-monitor-policy-compliance-at-scale-for-kubernetes-clusters>Apply policy bundles and monitor policy compliance at scale for Kubernetes clusters</a></li><li><a href=https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/manage-kubernetes-configuration-at-scale-using-the-new-gitops-observability-dashboard>Manage Kubernetes configuration at scale using the new GitOps observability dashboard</a></li><li><a href=https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/gitops-with-oci-artifacts-and-config-sync>Deploy OCI artifacts and Helm charts the GitOps way with Config Sync</a></li></ul><p>I was one of the main maintainers of the very popular <a href=https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo><strong>Online Boutique repository</strong></a>.

I created the Online Boutique’s Helm chart. <a href=https://medium.com/p/246119e46d53>Check these stories out</a>!</p><p>I created the <a href=https://acm-workshop.alwaysupalwayson.com/><strong>Config Management and Service Mesh workshop</strong></a>. It&rsquo;s a step-by-step guide to setup a secure GKE environment with services such as ASM, Cloud Armor, GKE Security Posture, Config Sync, Policy Controller, Dataplane V2, Artifact Registry, Spanner, Memorystore (Redis), etc. Everything is deployed with Config Connector and Config Sync. 3 sample apps are leveraged: Whereami, Online Boutique and Bank of Anthos. 3 personas are involved: Org Admin, Platform Admin and Apps Operator. Customers and Googlers gave me great feedback. It was my sandbox to learn and play with products and feed my friction logs.</p><h2 id=blogs>Blogs
