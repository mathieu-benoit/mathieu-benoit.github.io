A colleague of mine just shared this article on LinkedIn: [The Best Way to Respond to the Question, "What Do You Do?"](https://hbrascend.org/topics/the-best-way-to-respond-to-the-question-what-do-you-do/).

This reminded me that I took some notes and takeaways for myself from a training I took the opportunity to take: "The Coaching Habit" from Michael Bungay Stanier.
That's kind of training I love to take, not technical at all but improving my soft-skills helping me getting better as a human-being.

But when smart people get together around the table and focus on what they know instead of what they can learn, they often end up being defensive, resulting in missed opportunities instead of creating breakthrough innovation, Aviv Shahar
