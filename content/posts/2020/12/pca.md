I just successfully passed my [Google Professional Cloud Architect](https://cloud.google.com/certification/cloud-architect) certification. I'm really happy about that! Let me share with you the public materials and resources I leveraged for my preparation.

First of all, I'm a *learning-by-doing* person, so since I joined Google (~5 months ago) [I practiced by doing hands-on activities I documented on my blog]({{< ref "/tags/gcp" >}}) as well as doing engagements with my customers. Learning by doing the real stuffs! ;)

The other consideration is that I have already some Cloud Architecture knowledge with Microsoft Azure, so I leveraged this resource [Google Cloud for Azure professionals](https://cloud.google.com/docs/compare/azure) to help me get up to speed based on my previous experiences. If you are coming from the AWS world, you could find the same resource [here](https://cloud.google.com/docs/compare/aws).

To be honest with all of that said, my focus was not on the PCA by itself during the last 5 months, but more on broad architecture concepts focused on infrastructure, networking and security. And then few days/weeks before, I narrowed my focus based on few materials publicly available to prepare the PCA:
- [Official Exam guide](https://cloud.google.com/certification/guides/professional-cloud-architect)
- [Practice test with sample questions](https://cloud.google.com/certification/sample-questions/cloud-architect)
- [Cloud Study Jam: Getting Started - PCA](https://youtu.be/gG_TqsFpbdg)
- [Certification Prep: PCA](https://youtu.be/2oHIflLrCIE)
- [Hands-on Lab: Orchestrating the Cloud with Kubernetes (PCA)](https://youtu.be/TlxLWf8XrgA)
- [Hands-on Lab: Multiple VPC Networks (PCA)](https://youtu.be/ZcIN6Dag27o)
- [Official Practice Exam](https://cloud.google.com/certification/practice-exam/cloud-architect)

The last part of my preparation, because it was my first GCP certification ever, was about to reach out to colleagues and the community to get few feedback about what a GCP certification looks like, get few tips and tricks, etc. For example, with a quick search you could find this recent one: [How I got my Google Cloud Professional Architect certificate](https://medium.com/gdgeurope/how-i-got-my-google-cloud-professional-architect-certificate-4a522897eb0b). You could find a lot of examples like this in there too: [Awesome GCP Certifications resources](https://github.com/sathishvj/awesome-gcp-certifications/blob/master/professional-cloud-architect.md).

Certifications are a great way to learn, validate knowledge and make room for improvements. I learned a lot while preparing that one and I have already few pointers to improve my knowledge and skills on GCP ;) My next certification with GCP will be either the [Cloud Security Engineer](https://cloud.google.com/certification/cloud-security-engineer) or the new [Cloud Developer](https://cloud.google.com/certification/cloud-developer). Stay tuned!

Hope you will be able to leverage few pointers from this one for your own path to the Google PCA certification, cheers!
