My new blog is [here](https://alwaysupalwayson.com)! The old one was [there on Blogger](https://alwaysupalwayson.blogspot.com).

I just migrated my old articles to this new one by doing a "purge", meaning by removing some articles and just keeping the more important ones with the more value for others according to my focus: Open Source, Containers, DevOps, Cloud, Security and Kubernetes.

Blogger was fine for me, great helper to write, publish and host my blog articles. But I decided to move to a new self-hosted way as an opportunity for me to learn more:
- [Hugo website](https://gohugo.io) - I love the light and geeky way of writting Markdown files, Everything-as-Code!
- Container - I leverage the agile way to containerize my Hugo website to deploy it anywhere; from my local environment for dev/test to Kubernetes for my Production environment.
- Kubernetes - yet another app I want to deploy in my Kubernetes cluster to get more experiences with this.

For sure I lost on-purpose few features like Comments and Anylitics/Statistics on my blog articles... but to be honest I was not using them that much. So I made a choice here to not have yet equivalent to these features but that's something I could implement too (in the future).

So yes, I just wanted to make it Cloud Native by leveraging different concepts you could look at, directly in its public GitHub repository: [https://github.com/mathieu-benoit/myblog](https://github.com/mathieu-benoit/myblog):
- Docker - see [`Dockerfile` file](https://github.com/mathieu-benoit/myblog/blob/master/Dockerfile)
- Helm chart - see [`chart` folder](https://github.com/mathieu-benoit/myblog/tree/master/chart)
- Azure Pipelines - see [`azure-pipeline.yml` file](https://github.com/mathieu-benoit/myblog/blob/master/azure-pipeline.yml)
- And few more concepts and technologies such as: [`NetworkPolicies`]({{< ref "/posts/2019/09/calico.md" >}}), [`Pod Security Context`]({{< ref "/posts/2020/04/pod-security-context.md" >}}), `Nginx Ingress Controller`, etc.

I have been learning a lot (yes, that's a continuous journey)!

Hope you like this story and hope you will love this new UI and UX with my new blog!
