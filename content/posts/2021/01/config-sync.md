Today, let's see a GitOps setup in actions on GKE with [Config Sync](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/add-on/config-sync). I won't go with the definition of what is GitOps, but if you are new with the concept, [Weavework is doing a great job on explaining and illustrating what GitOps is](https://www.weave.works/technologies/gitops/). Another way to understand what is GitOps is to watch and listen to Kelsey Hightower during the last GitHub Universe conference: 

{{< youtube id="yIAa5wHsfw4" title="Kelsey, Kubernetes, and GitOps - GitHub Universe 2020" >}}

What I love about GitOps:
- Everything-as-Code in a Git repository: infrastructure, platform, config, policies, etc. as code
- Git flow as the continuous deployments workflow via Pull Requests and branches
- Continuous deployments by pulling Kubernetes manifests instead of having agent/tool pushing stuffs in Kubernetes: more secure, more centralized and way more simplified setup and control.

Now we have the concepts, what we would like to do here is creating a Git repository ready to host the Kubernetes manifests associated to the applications I would like to deploy on my Kubernetes cluster(s).

## Prepare the Git repository

Install `nomos`:
```
gsutil cp gs://config-management-release/released/latest/linux_amd64/nomos nomos
chmod +x nomos
sudo mv nomos /usr/local/bin/nomos
nomos version
```

Initialize your Git repo:
```
nomos init
nomos status
# git add, git push...
```

You now have this structure in your Git repository:
```
cluster/
clusterregistry/
namespaces/ # configs that are scoped to namespaces
system/
└── README.md
└── repo.yaml
```

Let's create our first Kubernetes manifest:
```
mkdir namespaces/hello
cat > namespaces/hello/policy.yaml << EOF
kind: Namespace
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: hello
EOF
# git add, git push...
```

You could check the syntax and validity of the configs in your repository:
```
nomos vet
```

## Prepare the Kubernetes cluster

Install Config Sync Operator on your current Kubernetes cluster:
```
# Option 1: Config Sync as standalone
gsutil cp gs://config-management-release/released/latest/config-sync-operator.yaml ~/tmp/config-sync-operator.yaml
kubectl apply -f ~/tmp/config-sync-operator.yaml

# Option 2: Config Sync via Anthos Config Management (ACM)
gsutil cp gs://config-management-release/released/latest/config-management-operator.yaml ~/tmp/config-management-operator.yaml
kubectl apply -f ~/tmp/config-management-operator.yaml
```

## Setup the continuous deployments

Setup the Config Sync Operator created earlier, to actually synchronised that repo in your current Kubernetes cluster:
```
clusterName=FIXME
syncRepo=FIXME
cat > ~/tmp/config-management.yaml << EOF
apiVersion: configmanagement.gke.io/v1
kind: ConfigManagement
metadata:
  name: config-management
spec:
  clusterName: $clusterName
  git:
    syncRepo: $syncRepo
    syncBranch: main
    secretType: none
    policyDir: .
EOF
kubectl apply -f ~/tmp/config-management.yaml
```

Wait for few seconds, and check everything is deployed and synchronized properly:
```
# You should see your cluster's status as SYNCED:
nomos status
gcloud alpha container hub config-management status

# You should now see the hello namespace we defined earlier:
kubectl get ns

# This hello namespace should be tagged as managed by Config Sync too:
kubectl get ns -l app.kubernetes.io/managed-by=configmanagement.gke.io
```

And that's it! Now, any update on this repository with any Kubernetes manifests will be synchronized and applied by Config Sync for you. From here, you may want to have different branches pointing to different clusters and having in place a solid and easy continuous deployments workflow via Pull Requests and branches.

Notes:
- Both `config-sync-operator.yaml` and `config-management.yaml` were dropped in the `~/tmp` folder because as a good practice they shouldn't be in the same repository than the one having your Kubernetes manifests. They could be in an other repository having the scripts for provisioning the infrastructure, such as the GKE cluster, etc.
- I used a public GitHub repository, in the real life you will need to [grant the Config Sync Operator access to your private Git repository](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/add-on/config-sync/how-to/installing#git-creds-secret).
- If you delete the Kubernetes objects managed and synchronized by Config Sync in your cluster, they will be recreated by Config Sync.
- You could manage the deployments on multi-clusters from within the same Git repository by using the concept of [Cluster selectors](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/add-on/config-sync/how-to/clusterselectors).
- For the upgrade of `nomos` and the Config Sync Operator, it's documented [here](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/add-on/config-sync/how-to/installing#upgrading_versions).
- `Helm` and `Kustomize` are not yet supported by Config Sync.
