On Saturday April, 21st 2018 was the 6th edition of the Global Azure Bootcamp: [https://global.azurebootcamp.net/](https://global.azurebootcamp.net/) all around the world hosted by 284 locations (in its first edition in 2013, it was just 90 locations).  
In Quebec city it was our 4th edition and we got ~200 people. We were lucky despite the sunny day we got, actually the first spring day there, to have such interest from our attendees.

Regarding the opening Keynote I co-delivered with [Adrian Todorov](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adriantodorov/), we did an interesting exercise to show 2 demos (Azure DevOps project + AKS) within the 1h15min slot we had in front of ~200 people. Here are some photos and [here is the document of our presentation](https://github.com/mathieu-benoit/presentations/raw/main/2018-04-GABC-OSSandAzure.pdf):

Again, a really great GABC 2018 edition which couldn't be a success without all the people, customers, partners and local communities mentioned in this blog article.
  
See you next year for sure! ;)
