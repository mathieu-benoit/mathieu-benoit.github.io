On June 16, 2018, [like last year](https://alwaysupalwayson.blogspot.com/2017/06/global-devops-bootcamp-2017-first.html), I co-organized as part of the [AzureQC Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/AzureQC/) the [Global DevOps Bootcamp 2018](http://globaldevopsbootcamp.com/) in its second edition. What a success, again!

Check out the story from one of the global organizers, [Rene van Osnabrugge](https://roadtoalm.com/2018/06/18/organizing-the-global-devops-bootcamp-2018/) and from one of his colleague, [Jesse Houwing](https://blog.jessehouwing.nl/global-devops-bootcamp-2018/). And learn [here from Michiel van Oudheusden](https://mindbyte.nl/2018/06/22/global-devops-bootcamp-provisioning-the-workitems.html) how they generated all the VSTS backlog/work items.

> _From once a month to multiple times a day, GDBC2018_

The global organizers learned from last year and they did an impressive and amazing job to make possible a great experience for all the locations all around the world.
- 8000 attendees
- 66 challenges
- 1050 VSTS projects
- 6000 Azure Passes
- 3000 VMs
- 75 locations

Locally in Quebec city, we had a lot of fun!
- 46 people (with 88 registrations...)
- 10 organizers/proctors
- 9 teams
- An amazing sponsor to host, feed and entertain us, [iA Financial Group](https://ia.ca/)
- We finished 4th in the world wide race! ;)
