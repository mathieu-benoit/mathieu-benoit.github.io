[Last night](https://www.meetup.com/AzureQC/events/254946993/), we hosted in [Le Camp](https://lecampquebec.com/en/) the Azure DevOps Community Launch Event in Quebec city. It's a world wide event to talk about the latest and greatest around Azure DevOps: [https://www.azuredevopslaunch.com/](https://www.azuredevopslaunch.com)  

The agenda was:
- **Introduction to Azure DevOps** by [Mathieu Benoit](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mathieubenoitqc), CSA at Microsoft and [AzureQC Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/AzureQC) organizer
- **Open Source projects with Azure DevOps** by [Hinault Donfack](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hinault-romaric-donfack-01678823), Microsoft Dev Tech MVP and [DotNetQC Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/DotNet-Quebec) organizer

- **Docker and Kubernetes with Azure DevOps** by [Julien Maitrehenry,](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jmaitrehenry) Microsoft Azure MVP and [DockerQC Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Docker-Quebec-Meetup) organizer

We were 30 people sharing expertise and knowledge around Azure DevOps, really love this kind of session driven by the community eager to share and learn!  
We got Subway lunch boxes and Azure DevOps t-shirts and stickers, thanks Microsoft and the local community!
