_tl;dr: There is a lot of content and sessions discussed in this blog article, in case you would like to know what are the top 5 sessions I found very insightful on an App Modernization standpoint, here you are:_
- _[An App Modernization Story with Cloud Run](https://cloud.withgoogle.com/next/sf/sessions?session=APP236#application-modernization) [[Youtube](https://youtu.be/KY4DozBVV1Y)], great journey from monolith (Windows VM) to microservices (serverless Linux Container)._
- _[Building Globally Scalable Services with Istio and ASM](https://cloud.withgoogle.com/next/sf/sessions?session=APP210#application-modernization) [[Youtube](https://youtu.be/clu7t0LVhcw)], great definition of what's a service mesh._
- _[GitOps Workflows with GitLab and Anthos for Hybrid Cloud](https://cloud.withgoogle.com/next/sf/sessions?session=APP235#application-modernization) [[Youtube](https://youtu.be/npc08ggdTOw)], great session about GitOps in the context of multi GKE clusters managed via Anthos Configuration Management._
- _[Anthos Deep Dive: Part One](https://cloud.withgoogle.com/next/sf/sessions?session=APP316#application-modernization) [[Youtube](https://youtu.be/be_bXETvbuE)], great walkthrough of ACM, Anthos GKE (on GCP, on-premise on AWS) and Cloud Monitoring and Logging._

_Furthermore if you are looking for all the announcements in one place, here you are: [Next OnAir as it happens: All the announcements in one place](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/google-cloud-next/complete-list-of-announcements-from-google-cloud-next20-onair). There is also this one pager below:_

What a perfect timing! While I'm doing my onboarding as [a Noogler](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mathieubenoitqc_cloud-innovation-continuouslearning-activity-6685996290330947584-bKkB), I have the opportunity to (e-)attend my first Google conference. Yes for sure, I'm a bit disapointed because like everyone I won't be able to travel to San Francisco or somewhere else to attend in-person such conference during 4-5 days. But I actually feel more lucky than if I would have. In deed, without traveling I have 9 weeks of content thanks to this incredible new format of Google Next: [Google Next OnAir 2020](https://cloud.withgoogle.com/next/sf/)!

I'm very impressed about the quality, the unicity and the huge amount of content from this conference. Most, if not all, of the sessions are ~20 min long, very convenient. It's very unique because it's during 9 weeks, with for sure sessions but many different other formats to learn about GCP:
- [Session packages](https://cloud.withgoogle.com/next/sf/sessions#session-packages)
- [Cloud Hero](https://go.qwiklabs.com/cloudheronext)
- [Cloud Study Jam](https://cloudonair.withgoogle.com/events/next20-studyjam)
- [Demos](https://cloud.withgoogle.com/next/sf/demos)
- [Live Dev Talks](https://cloudonair.withgoogle.com/events/talks-by-devrel)

I took the opportunity to watch most of the App Modernization sessions, here below are the links and few notes I captured:

2020 is a very weird year for sure because of the covid-19 situation, I feel very priviledged to work in IT and very grateful and proud to work for a company like Google, providing such amazing new way to learn and (e-)attend and consume conference. This blog article is mostly focused on the App Modernization area, but like discussed at the beginning of this blog article, [there is more with past or upcoming sessions](https://gregsramblings.com/blog/google-cloud-next-onair-cheat-sheet). I hope you feel like me engergized and envisioned with all of this! ;)
