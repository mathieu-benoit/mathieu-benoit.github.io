Recommended by the [Gates Notes in 2019](https://www.gatesnotes.com/About-Bill-Gates/Holiday-Books-2019), I recently read the book, [Prepared, What kids need for a fulfilled life, by Diane Tavenner](https://preparedparents.org/the-book/). Here are the notes I captured about it, very insightful.

Diane Tavenner is the cofounder and CEO of the [Summit Public Schools](https://summitps.org/), one of America's most innovative public-school networks. In this book, she shares a blueprint for how parents can stop worrying about their children's future and start helping them prepare for it.

Diane shares concrete illustrations and examples FIXME.

Part 1: Why prepare?

The best way to get your kids accepted to selective schools is to help them develop their sense of purpose and to really understand who they are as unique individuals.

Part 2: How to prepare?

Develop the skills and habits they need to be successful in life, learning is designed to be focused on the real world every single day. Projects begin with a problem, question, or challenge that is relevant to the student and his community and life. As students moves toward a solution, they get timely and actionable feedback, so the improve as they go.

Project-Based learning (PBL) works as "a teaching method in which students gain knowledge and skills by working for an extended period of time to investigate and respond to an authentic, engaging, and complex question, problem, or challenge."
Research has shown that when students learn through projects, they retain what they've learned for longer, and they understand it more deeply.
PBL students are stronger problem-solvers, and better able to apply their learning to real-life situations.
For any parent or teacher who has struggled to motivate a teenager to do their work, what projects can do to inspire them is huge.
Students who are struggling are also more engaged by project-based learning, making it a promising strategy for all students, not just those who are already thriving.
