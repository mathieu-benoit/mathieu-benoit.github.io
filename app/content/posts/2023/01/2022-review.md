Looking back every year is an interesting 
For 2021, I did: https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mathieubenoitqc_googlecloud-kubernetes-canada-activity-6884693753190252544-3rau

I started my new role as DevRel Engineer from Cloud Architect (Sales) --> DevRel.

I have been focusing on K8s/GKE/Anthos.

What a year, I really much liked it!

On one hand, I learned how to DevRel and on the other hand I brought and shared my 15 years of experience as software engineer and cloud architect.

What was my focus

My focus was on two main areas:
- GKE/Anthos overall experience, how to connect the dots between different Google Cloud Services and containers running on Kubernetes
- Anthos Config Management

What I did

Product feedback
It's all about connecting the dots between docs, products, stakeholders and end users
Voice of the end users
Enabling end users, customers and colleagues
Customers/End users focused/obsessed
Dilemna: new features/releases, multi products/stakeholders with their own priorities/roadmap, re-org/role changes to live with, etc.
Internal motion/meeting/platform tool versus the end users benefits
presenting and connecting with the community
