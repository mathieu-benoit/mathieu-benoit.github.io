I have prepared and successfully passed [Exam AZ-500: Microsoft Azure Security Technologies](https://www.microsoft.com/learning/exam-az-500.aspx) and would like to share here the resources I've leveraged to be prepared.

There is actually two good preparation guides out there, see below. I won't go through the details of them, but it's highly encouraged to leverage them:
- From [Stanislas Quastana](https://stanislas.io/2019/04/25/preparation-guide-for-microsoft-az-500-microsoft-azure-security-technologies-certification/)
- From [Thomas Maurer](https://www.thomasmaurer.ch/2019/06/exam-az-500-azure-security-engineer-associate/)

Furthermore, based on what I have learned while writing my [Security with Microsoft Azure]({{< ref "/posts/2019/05/azure-security.md" >}}) blog article few months ago, here are helpful resources I leveraged to complete my learning with more hands-on experiences:
- Microsoft Learn
    - [Security, responsibility and trust in Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/intro-to-security-in-azure/)
    - [Secure your cloud data](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/paths/secure-your-cloud-data/)
    - [Secure and isolate access to Azure resources by using NSG and service endpoints](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/secure-and-isolate-with-nsg-and-service-endpoints/)
- [Security baseline on Azure](https://github.com/Microsoft/MCW-Security-baseline-on-Azure), a Microsoft Cloud Workshop with whiteboard and hands-on lab
- [Azure Security Center labs](https://github.com/tianderturpijn/Azure-Security-Center/tree/master/Labs)
- [Microsoft Learning AZ-500 Labs](https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/AZ-500-Azure-Security)

I have been learning a lot (yep, I still have room of improvements and learnings!) to improve my security posture while doing Architecture Design & Review sessions, this [Azure Security Benchmarks](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security/benchmarks/introduction) resource is a good one to leverage on that regard.

Hope that helps, happy learning and please stay safe and secure! ;)
