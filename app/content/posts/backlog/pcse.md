I also took the courses from Coursera (Pluralsight has the same ones):
- [Managing Security in Google Cloud Platform](https://www.coursera.org/learn/managing-security-in-google-cloud-platform/home/welcome)
- [Networking in Google Cloud: Defining and Implementing Networks](https://www.coursera.org/learn/networking-gcp-defining-implementing-networks?specialization=google-cloud-security)
- [Networking in Google Cloud: Hybrid Connectivity and Network Management](https://www.coursera.org/learn/networking-gcp-hybrid-connectivity-network-management?specialization=google-cloud-security)
- [Hands-On Labs in Google Cloud for Security Engineers](https://www.coursera.org/learn/hands-on-labs-google-cloud-security-engineer)

In my case I didn't know enough 2 topics, so I did more learnings around them:
- [Data Loss Prevention (DLP)](https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/gettingstartedwithdatalossprevention) service, mind blowing! Very powerful API that I took the time to learn more about to be able to use and talk about it.
