There is always room to improve and continue to grow our skills and knowledge. The new book I read - [Mindset, the new psychology of success, Carol S. Dweck, Ph.D.](https://www.amazon.com/Mindset-Psychology-Carol-S-Dweck/dp/0345472322), was brought to me while I was reading this article last April 2017: [Microsoft's CEO Just Gave Some Brilliant Career Advice. Here It Is in 1 Sentence](https://www.inc.com/justin-bariso/microsofts-ceo-just-gave-some-brilliant-career-advice-here-it-is-in-one-sentence.html). This "1 Sentence" from [Satya Nadella](https://www.linkedin.com/in/satya-nadella-3145136/) who got it by reading this book was:

> _"Don't be a know-it-all; be a learn-it-all."_

This quotation rang my bell, and this sound told me that I will really love this book.

Satya is very inspiring to me, he has this mindset and this leadership that I admire. Recently, for the end of FY17 and the beginning of FY18 (i.e last day of June 2017), as Microsoft employees, we received an internal email from him and he had this really great statement:

> _"Every day I ask myself if I am approaching my work with a growth mindset and more importantly recognizing all the fixed mindset moments that I can learn from."_

On the front cover we could find what this book is going to deal with: "How we can learn to fulfill our potential for: parenting, business, school, relationships". The author, based on personal and professional stories and illustrations by research studies, brings us throughout this book in a journey between two mindsets: fixed versus growth.

Here are some of the statements I have found really interesting to understand and illustrate how we could go from the first one to the second one.

# Be smart/intelligent

**Fixed Mindset** :thumbsdown:
- Be smart is about being perfect right now.
- Feel smart when they don't make any mistakes, finish something fast and it's perfect. When something is easy for her/him but not for other people.
- You can learn new things, but you can't really change how intelligent you are.

**Growth Mindset** :thumbsup:
- Smart is about learning: confronting challenge and making  progress.
- When it's really hard and I can do something I couldn't do before or when I work on something a long time and I start to figure it out. It's not about immediate perfection.
- You can always substantially change how intelligent you are.

# Success versus Failure (p. 33)

**Fixed Mindset** :thumbsdown:
- Success is being better than others. Failure is a condemnation.
- The loss of one's self to failure can be a permanent, haunting trauma.
- Students who will have an academic test failure, will study less and consider cheating then.
- Someone praising a student having an academic test success, will say: "you must be smart and so talented at this".

**Growth Mindset** :thumbsup:
- Success is being your best self. Failure is an opportunity.
- It could be a painful experience but it doesn't define you. It's a problem to be faced, dealt with and learned from.
- Students who will have an academic test failure, will study better and harder next time.
- Someone praising a student having an academic test success, will say: "you must have worked really hard at this".

**Fixed Mindset** :thumbsdown:
- You have certain level of ability in sports and you cannot really do much to change that level.
- To be good at sports you need to be naturally gifted.

**Growth Mindset** :thumbsup:

- To be successful in sports, you need to learn techniques and skills and them regularly.

# Parents, teachers, coaches, etc. (p. 176)

**Fixed Mindset** :thumbsdown:
- You have permanent traits and I'm judging them.

- At the dinner table each evening, you and your partner structure the discussion around the growth mindset, asking each child: what did you learn today? what mistake did you make that taught your something? what did you try hard at today?
- Champs are the people who work the hardest. You can become a champ. Tomorrow tell me something you've done to become a champ.

The author concludes this book by providing some tips about "The journey to a (true) growth mindset":  
1.  Acknowledge that you have both mindsets: fixed and growth;
2.  Embrace your fixed mindset;
3.  Become aware of your fixed mindset triggers;
4.  Give your fixed mindset persona a name;
5.  Educate your fixed mindset.

As sportsman, leader, spouse, parent, coach, negotiator, speaker, friend, teammate, etc., I personally and professionally really appreciate this book and what it has brought, it brings and it's going to bring to me and my growth mindset. It's not about knowing all and be successful on everything... it's more about how we can learn and adapt our thoughts and actions based on what we have worked (hard) on and finally how we continuously improve this process, our knowledge, etc. and how we are facing to new challenge, non-comfortable zone, and even failure...

Enjoy!
